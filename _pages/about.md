Mary Angelique Demetillo recently earned her Ph.D. in environmental sciences with a focus on atmospheric chemistry from the University of Virginia. In her dissertation titled, [“Observing air pollution variability with climate change and environmental injustice,”](https://libraetd.lib.virginia.edu/public_view/rn301247v) Angelique integrated socio-demographic information with remote-sensing observations onboard aircraft and satellites to understand the spatiotemporal variability of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) air pollution within cities, assess the ability of next-generation satellite observations to resolve inequalities at the neighborhood-level, and identify drivers of NO2 inequalities across US cities. 

Currently, she works in the Chemistry and Dynamics Branch of the Science Directorate investigating the surface and near-surface representativity of widely-anticipated near-surface ozone (O3) product from NASA’s recently-launched Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of POllution (TEMPO) space-based sensor and contributing to airborne science research campaigns focused on atmospheric composition and trace gas spatiotemporal variability in major cities. Alongside her research career, she continues to serve on executive and leadership teams driving initiatives to increase visibility, representation, and support for under-represented minorities in the atmospheric sciences.
